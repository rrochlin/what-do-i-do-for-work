We are inside of a reveal.js starter project that I want to customize and deploy to vercel for a slideshow presentation. This presentation is going to be on what I do for work. I am an app developer/analyst at a utility company. I want to make the presentation both informative and visually engaging. To this end I’ve prepared this outline of the order I want to present my slides in and what they will be.
